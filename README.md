# OOP Game Show App

## Objective

<p>Create a browser-based, word guessing game called "Phrase Hunter".</p>

## How the game works

- A random phrase will be selected when a new game is started. This will display a set of empty rectengles that represent each letter in the phrase. You get 5 lives (tries) to guess incorrectly.
- When a letter is selected, either by using the gameboard keyboard or physical keyboard, the program will check if the letter matches a letter in the phrase.
- If the letter matches, all matching letters in the phrase will be displayed on the gameboard. If the letter does not match, you will loose a life.
- The game ends when you:
  1. Guess all the phrase letters correctly before using up all 5 lives, OR
  2. Use up all 5 lives before guessing all of the letters in the phrase.

## Extra Credit

Optional extra credit tasks that I've added to this project:

- Added keyboard funcitonality so that players can choose between the gameboard keyboard or their own physical computer keyboard.
- [ ] in progress: make project my own by changing
